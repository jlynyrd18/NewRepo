        <h3>What is silver?</h3>
        <p>
            Silver is a metal that is mined out of the ground. It can be found underground on just any continent except Antartica. It is highly sought after for its properties,
            and its uses. It is more conductive and more malleable than other metals. It serves a purpose in many fields like electronics, medical, investmens, water filtration,
            jewellery, glass, bandages, and so much more. With so much demand for silver, and with a demand that keeps growing, the question rises how is silver so cheap
            compared to its high price back in 1980s?

        <h3>How is it short?</h3>
        <p>Silver is listed as a commodity. A commodity is a tangible good that can be bought, sold, or exchanged for products of similar value. The commodity market seems to lack 
        security when investors and traders enter the market. Some have been known to offer to sell products like silver and gold, but before the contract is finalized the sellers
        buy back the contract, hopefully at a lower price. The issue with this being done is many people are doing it, and not all are able to back the contract up if the buyer 
        demands delivery of said product. A rough estimate of how many contracts are on the market that are not backed can be found
