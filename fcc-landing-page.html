            <h3>What is silver?</h3>
            <p>
                Silver is a metal that is mined out of the ground. It can be found underground on just any continent except Antartica. It is highly sought after for its properties,
                and its uses. It is more conductive and more malleable than other metals. It serves a purpose in many fields like electronics, medical, investmens, water filtration,
                jewellery, glass, bandages, and so much more. If someone wants to buy some there's usually three choices of style of metal to buy, silver coins, which are backed by a 
                government, a bar, which is usually in a rectangle shape in some way, or a round, which is in the shape of a coin but not backed by a government body.With so much demand 
                for silver, and with a demand that keeps growing, the question rises how is silver so cheap compared to its high price back in 1980s?

            <h3>How is it short?</h3>
            <p>
                Silver is listed as a commodity. A commodity is a tangible good that can be bought, sold, or exchanged for products of similar value. The commodity market seems to lack
                security when investors and traders enter the market. Some have been known to offer to sell products like silver and gold, but before the contract is finalized the sellers
                buy back the contract, hopefully at a lower price. The issue with this being done is many people are doing it, and not all are able to back the contract up if the buyer
                demands delivery of said product. A rough estimate of how many contracts are on the market that are not backed can be found
                <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/gold-precious-metals.html" target="_blank" id="tribute-link">here</a>. What you are looking for is the paper to silver ratio. That is how many contracts
                are out on a single piece of silver.

            <h3>What could happen?</h3>
            <p>Exessive greed has driven this market to massive manipulation. As well as under handed dealings. It is also said the governements are allowing use of their gold and silver reserves
            to keep the price of these metals down. But the big question to ask is what happens if a person or a business demands delivery, and the seller can't meet their demands? If they don't have 
            the metals on hand they will have to go out on the market and buy some to cover the contract. Since they have to go out into the market to get the metals that adds to the buying power, and 
            drives the price of it even higher. There is no pin pointing the top, but some long time investors believe in the coming years it could sky rocket. There have been predictions of up to triple
            digit silver for a norm. There are also some that believe within the next decade it could be squeezed to almost one thousand dollars. It is only around thirty dollars at the moment, and with 
            demand growing even more from everywhere for everything electric the supply could get squeezed to almost and hopefuly at least ten fold. Many investors are buying now, but there have been other 
            investors that have been holding silver since before the 2008 financail crisis. Many continue to buy into silver every chance they can, knowing the government is printing currency nonstop.</p>
